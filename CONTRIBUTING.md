The only requirement is to have any experience with the technology you will write, and like us, a lot of love for the things we do ‚ù§Ô∏è.

### Article Contribution

You are at the right place to start or increase your passion for technical writing. 

To contribute with some article, follow the next steps:

1. Check if your article is [here](insert-your-topic-list-link-here). If not, all suggestions are welcome.
2. **@Bartosz, write a way to contact you and Konrad (Maybe a link to your inbox in discord).**
3. Clone this repository and create a new branch with a name like `new-article/name-of-the-article` (locally).
4. Once you have an article and his body in mind, we will give you access to a "Surfer SEO" text editor. "Surfer SEO" will helps you to write crazy articles with a terrific SEO impact.
4. Meanwhile, add you as a new author, go to `_config.yml` and add a new contributor entry at `contributors` (respecting the YAML format), something like this:

```yml
  "John Doe": # Your name as a key or id
    slug: john-done 
    desc: Here goes your great description. # Write a good description
    specs: [javascript, vue, nodejs, python, react] # More or less if you want
    image: /img/contributors/john-doe.jpeg # Choose your best pic and add it at this path
    motto: Here goes your motto. # A motivational phrase, your mantra
    joined: 01 Jan 2023 # Your join date 
    academies:          # If you are in some academy at dev-academy.com change it to true
      wsa: false        # Web Security Academy
      fta: false        # Full Testing Academy
    socials:  # URLs from Social Networks, Blogs, Personal Websites...
      site: https://john-done.github.io/
      github: https://github.com/john-done
      twitter: https://twitter.com/john-done
      linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-done
```

5. Commit the changes with a message like `feat: new author`
6. Write your article in "Surfer SEO" which is a friendly text editor like Word or Google Docs, but you will receive constant feedback on the SEO impact on a scale of 0 to 100 (that is the nice thing), try to reach 72 points at least if you want good results.
7. Once you have done the article, go to tools and choose `Download content as HTML`.
8. This project needs articles written in Markdown. So, you have to convert HTML to Markdown, go to this [page](https://codebeautify.org/html-to-markdown), and convert it.
9. Go to the `source/_posts` directory path, create a readme file called as your article in the `kebab case format` (e.g. `source/_posts/csurf-vulnerability.md`), and copy the content of your converted article.
10. If you have images, you need to create a directory called `source/_posts/csurf-vulnerability` (as your article readme file), and add them here, @bartosz-io will give you a `banner.png` file to paste into this directory.
11. The markdown file that you already paste needs some treatments. First of all, we need to change the `h2` heading style.

from:
```md
Vanilla JavaScript Style
------------------------
```
to 
```md
## Vanilla JavaScript Style
```

After that, add a table of contents (only copy this  code at some good nice on your article):

```md
## Table of Contents
<!-- toc -->
```

Replace the markdown image way to get images from an external URL to 
a format that needs this blog system (download the image and paste it at 
your images directory, remember, you've created at step number 10).

from:

```md
![simple react component, single logic example](https://images.surferseo.art/5b6d9719-266f-4f93-a999-44d81fc570cf.png)
```

To this format (the large message will be the `alt` property of the `<img >` HTML tag when the blog will be at production):

```md
{% img "simple_example.png" "simple react component, single logic example" "lazy" %}
```

Finally, add your author, article, and banner metadata at the start of the file.

```
