## Article Contribution

To contribute with some article, follow the next steps:

1. Find a topic (in your preferable tech stack - Java, Node, Python, PHP, etc.) related to:
    - web application security for developers
    - testing and automation (unit tests, DevOps, etc)
2. Join Dev Academy [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tXrGY7ca43) to become a contributor
3. Clone this repository and create a new branch with a name like `new-article/name-of-the-article` (locally).
4. Once you have an article and his body in mind, we will give you access to a `Surfer SEO` text editor. `Surfer SEO` will helps you to write crazy articles with a terrific SEO impact üöÄ
5. Meanwhile, add you as a new author, go to `_config.yml` and add a new contributor entry at `contributors` (respecting the YAML format), something like this:

```yml
  "John Doe": # Your name as a key or id
    slug: john-done 
    desc: Here goes your great description. # Write a good description
    specs: [javascript, vue, nodejs, python, react] # More or less if you want
    image: /img/contributors/john-doe.jpeg # Choose your best pic and add it at this path
    motto: Here goes your motto. # A motivational phrase, your mantra
    joined: 01 Jan 2023 # Your join date 
    academies:          # If you are in some academy at dev-academy.com change it to true
      wsa: false        # Web Security Academy
      fta: false        # Full Testing Academy
    socials:  # URLs from Social Networks, Blogs, Personal Websites...
      site: https://john-done.github.io/
      github: https://github.com/john-done
      twitter: https://twitter.com/john-done
      linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-done
```

6. Commit the changes with a message like `feat: new author`
7. Write your article in `Surfer SEO` which is a friendly text editor like Word or Google Docs, but you will receive constant feedback on the SEO impact on a scale of 0 to 100 (that is the nice thing), try to reach 72 points at least if you want good results.
8. Use a FREE version of [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/browser/chrome) for fix all the grammar issues while the content is still in `Surfer SEO`.
9. Once you have done the article, go to tools and choose `Download content as HTML`.
10. This project needs articles written in Markdown. So, you have to convert HTML to Markdown, go to this [page](https://codebeautify.org/html-to-markdown), and convert it.
11. Go to the `source/_posts` directory path, create a readme file called as your article in the `kebab case format` (e.g. `source/_posts/csurf-vulnerability.md`), and copy the content of your converted article.
12. If you have images, you need to create a directory called `source/_posts/csurf-vulnerability` (as your article Markdown .md file), and add them here, @bartosz-io will give you a `banner.png` file to paste into this directory.
13. The markdown file that you already paste needs some treatments.
    - Run [Markdown lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) in your preferable IDE
    - Apply the changes described below: üëá

- Change the `h2` heading style from:

```md
Vanilla JavaScript Style
------------------------
```
to:
```md
## Vanilla JavaScript Style
```

- After that, add a table of contents (only copy this  code at some good nice on your article):

```md
## Table of Contents
<!-- toc -->
```

- Replace the markdown image way to get images from an external URL to a format that needs this blog system (download the image and paste it at your images directory, remember, you've created at step number 10) from:

```md
![simple react component, single logic example](https://images.surferseo.art/5b6d9719-266f-4f93-a999-44d81fc570cf.png)
```

to this format (the large message will be the `alt` property of the `<img>` HTML tag when the blog will be at production):

```md
{% img "simple_example.png" "simple react component, single logic example" "lazy" %}
```

- Finally, add your author, article, and banner metadata at the start of the file.

```yaml
