## Introduction

Local storage, session storage, and cookies are all terms that most of us are familiar with. But what are they exactly, what problems do they solve, and how do they differ? This article will explain what problems they solve, how they differ, as well as how to use `sessionStorage` in a simple Angular project.

## What is Local Storage, Session Storage, and Cookies

In web development, session storage and local storage are useful alternatives to cookie-based storage for storing data alongside stateless HTTP requests. While cookies are the most well-known and oldest storage mechanism, session storage and local storage have several advantages.

Both session storage and local storage allow developers to store data on the client-side, meaning that the data is stored locally in the user's browser. However, there are some key differences between the two.

Session storage is designed to store data for a single browsing session. This means that the data is lost as soon as the user closes the browser window or tab. On the other hand, local storage stores data permanently, until it is manually deleted by the user or cleared by the developer.

Because of these differences, session storage is more suitable for storing temporary data that is only needed for the duration of a single browsing session. Local storage, on the other hand, is more appropriate for storing data that needs to persist between multiple browsing sessions.

Overall, session storage and local storage are both useful tools for web developers, providing an efficient and secure way to store data on the client-side without relying on cookies.

### Local Storage

Nowadays, most web applications require user input for various purposes, such as registration, personalization, and caching. Typically, this input is transmitted to a server for processing and storage. However, some applications may need to store data locally on the user's computer, especially if offline access is desired. This is where local storage comes in handy.

Local storage is a recent mechanism that allows web developers to store data on the client-side, meaning that the data is stored on the user's computer rather than on a remote server. This approach offers several advantages, such as faster access, better privacy, and reduced server load.

To use local storage, developers must first generate a key-value pair, where the key represents the data's name, and the value represents the data itself. This can be done using JavaScript or other programming languages that support the Web Storage API. Once the key-value pair is created, it can be stored in local storage, where it will remain until it is explicitly deleted by the user or cleared by the developer.

Local storage is particularly useful for storing data that the user may need later, such as preferences, settings, or offline data. By leveraging local storage, web developers can create more responsive and robust applications that work seamlessly both online and offline.

### Session Storage

Session storage is a popular mechanism for storing data on the client-side in web applications. It works similarly to cookies, but with some notable differences.

Like cookies, session storage stores data only for the duration of the current session. This means that when a user closes their browser or a tab, the data is automatically cleared, and any previously stored information is deleted. This approach provides better privacy and security, as sensitive data, such as login credentials, can be stored temporarily without risking long-term exposure.

However, session storage differs from cookies in that it stores data directly on the user's computer, rather than sending it back and forth between the client and server. This approach reduces server load and improves performance, as data can be accessed more quickly and efficiently.

Overall, session storage is a valuable tool for web developers who need to store data temporarily and securely. By leveraging session storage, developers can create more user-friendly and robust applications that protect users' privacy and enhance their experience. Session storage is an excellent way to improve the performance of your web applications by reducing the amount of data transferred between the client and server. It can also be used to store data more securely because the data is not stored in cookies where third-party sites can access it.

### Cookies

Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's device by a website they visit. They are generated by the website's server and sent to the user's browser, where they are stored. Cookies store information about the user's interactions with the website, such as login credentials, user preferences, and shopping cart contents. Cookies are used for a variety of purposes, including authentication, personalization, tracking, and analytics.

## Angular Session Storage

Let's look at how to store, get, delete specific data, or remove all data in Angular's `sessionStorage`.

API methods for working with key-value pair data are incorporated into session storage.

It should be noted that both key and value are string types, and if you want to keep a different data type, you must convert it to a string first.

### Saving data using sessionStorage

Create a `dataSave()` function in the `app.component.ts` file to store data in `sessionStorage`.

```typescript
dataSave(){
}
```
    
Use `setItem` within the `dataSave()` function to keep the name in the `sessionStorage`.

Syntax:

```typescript
sessionStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
```

Thus, this is how our `app.component.ts` will appear:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'new_project';

  dataSave(){
    sessionStorage.setItem('name', 'Sanjeev');
  }
}
```

Now, open the `app.component.html` file and add a button to the `dataSave()` function with a click event. As a result, the `app.component.html` file will look something like this.

```html
<h1>Angular sessionStorage</h1>
<button (click)="dataSave()">Save data to sessionStorage</button>
```

{% img "save-data.jpg" "Save data in angular session storage" "lazy" %}

When you click the "Save data to sessionStorage" button, the key "name" and the value "Sanjeev" will be saved.

This can be verified by inspecting the page and going to `application > session storage`.

{% img "session-storage.jpg" "Verify saved data in angular session storage" "lazy" %}

If we close the browser or this tab, the session data stored will be automatically cleared.

### Retrieve data from Session Storage

We will add a `get()` function to our `app.component.ts` file to retrieve and display the data stored in session storage.

```typescript
get(){
}
```
Within the `get()` function, we will use `getItem` to retrieve data from the `sessionStorage` based on the key.

Syntax:

```typescript
sessionStorage.getItem('key');
```

Thus, this is how our code in the `app.component.ts` will appear:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'new_project';

  dataSave(){
    sessionStorage.setItem('name', 'Sanjeev');
  }

  get(){
    return sessionStorage.getItem('name');
  }
}
```

To display the data stored in session storage, add a `p` tag to the `app.component.html` file and call the `get` method within that `p` tag.

```html
<h1>Angular sessionStorage</h1>
<button (click)="dataSave()">Save data to sessionStorage</button>
<p>{{ get() }}</p>
```

{% img "view-data.jpg" "View Data in angular session storage" "lazy" %}

### Deleting data based on key

For deleting the data saved in session storage based on the key, first, we will create a `dataRemove()` function in the `app.component.ts` file.

```typescript
dataRemove(){
}
```

Inside the `dataRemove()` function add `removeItem` to remove specific data from the `sessionStorage` based on key.

Syntax:

```typescript
localStorage.removeItem("key");
```

Thus, this is how `app.component.ts` will appear:

```typescript
dataRemove(){
  sessionStorage.removeItem('name');
}
```

After this, add a button in `app.component.html` file that'll help us remove the stored data.

```html
<button (click)="dataRemove()">Remove data from sessionStorage</button>
```

{% img "remove-data.jpg" "Remove data in angular session storage" "lazy" %}

> Note: To clarify things, you can store multiple data in session storage and then use this method to remove specific data.

For example, I've added a few additional data to our session storage, and I'll specifically remove the data with key value as Name.

```typescript
dataSave(){
    sessionStorage.setItem('Name', 'Sanjeev');
    sessionStorage.setItem('Country', 'India');
    sessionStorage.setItem('Age', '22');
  }
dataRemove(){
    sessionStorage.removeItem('Name');
```

### Delete all data from Session Storage

For deleting all data from session storage first we'll create a `deleteAll()` function in the `app.component.ts` file.

```typescript
deleteAll(){
}
```
Now in this function, we will use clear to delete all data from session storage.

Syntax:

```typescript
deleteAll(){
  sessionStorage.clear();
}
```
Now, add a button to clear all data in the `app.component.html` file with a click event.

```html
<button (click)="deleteAll()">Clear sessionStorage</button>
```

{% img "clear-data.jpg" "Clear all data in angular session storage" "lazy" %}

In the end, our files will look like this:
```typescript app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'new_project';

  dataSave(){
    sessionStorage.setItem('name', 'Sanjeev');
  }

  get(){
    return sessionStorage.getItem('name');
  }

  dataRemove(){
    sessionStorage.removeItem('name');
  }

  deleteAll(){
    sessionStorage.clear();
  }
}
```
    
```html app.component.html
<h1>Angular sessionStorage</h1>
<button (click)="dataSave()">Save data to sessionStorage</button>
<p>{{ get() }}</p>
<button (click)="dataRemove()">Remove data from sessionStorage</button>
<button (click)="deleteAll()">Clear sessionStorage</button>
```

## Angular Local Storage

A `localStorage` object can be set, accessed, removed, or cleared with a single line of code, just like session storage.

### Save data in localStorage

A `localStorage` object can be set with a single line of javascript code, just like session storage.

```typescript
localStorage.setItem("key", "value");
```

### Retrieve data from localStorage

```typescript
localStorage.getItem("key");
```

### Remove specific data from localStorage based on key

```typescript
localStorage.removeItem("key");
```

### Remove all data from localStorage

```typescript
localStorage.clear();
```

## Conclusion

We learned about local storage and session storage, and we built a simple application with session storage. We saved data, viewed data, deleted some data, and deleted everything. The task for you in deleting specific data is to add more data to session storage and then try deleting one specific data.
